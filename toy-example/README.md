## Simple Toy Example

The code is tested with Python v3.9.5 and pygame v2.5.2. Install the following packages to run the example:
```
pkg_resources==0.0.0
pygame==2.5.2
```

The example contains two algorithms: Greedy and MACOL. Running `main.py` without argument will execute Greedy algorithm. Use `-m` option with 1 to run MACOL. The following will trigger MACOL:
```bash
python main.py -m 1
```
