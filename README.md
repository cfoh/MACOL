# Introduction

In this repo, we provide the numarical computation of beam analysis we presented in our paper:

  Allocation in mmWave Vehicular Communications," to appear in IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems.

# Numerical Validation

We share our numerical computation unit test source code runnable online:

# Simulation Code

The user simulation code is also available in this repo [[click here to see the code]](https://github.com/cfoh/MACOL/blob/main/test-macol.py).

The simulation code requires 
[![Pymosim v0.8.8](https://img.shields.io/badge/Pymosim-v0.8.8-brightgreen)](https://cfoh.github.io/pymosim-doc/start.html) 
platform to run. We plan to open the source of Pymosim Platform soon.
Meanwhile, you can inspect the simulation code and understand the simulation setup.
